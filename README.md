# Krus

A C++ library for working with regular expressions and parsers, implemented from scratch using state-machines.

This is mostly intended as a learning experience for myself, and is not intended for production use (at least not now).

This project serves has the following goals:

- Learn how regular expressions work under the hood
- Learn about automata and languages
    - Finite state machines and context-free grammars
    - Learn about parsers (e.g. LR(k)-parsers)
- Achieve a leve of maturity that allows this library to be used in other small project (e.g. a toy database with a query language).
- Get better at C++ (in particular template (meta-)programming)
- Get getter at test driven development	
    - This project uses Catch2
